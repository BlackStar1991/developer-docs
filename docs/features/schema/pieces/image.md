Describes an individual image (usually in the context of an embedded media object).

**NOTE**: Whilst an `image` node can accept a simple URL representing an image file, we always enforce the use of an `ImageObject` to enable referencing-by-ID.

## Triggers
Should be added as top-level nodes in the graph, as/when required by other nodes. E.g., when a `WebPage` has a *featured image*.

## Required properties
A valid `ImageObject` must have the following properties.

* `@id`: The site's home URL appended by `#/schema/image/{{ID}}`, where `{{ID}}` is a globally unique, stable identifier (e.g., a database ID representing the image object).
* `contentUrl`: The fully-qualified, absolute URL of the image file (e.g., `https://www.example.com/images/cat.jpg`).

## Failure scenarios
When we cannot ascertain the ID of an image but _can_ ascertain its URL (e.g., in the case of filtering for external media storage), then the `@id` property should be set to the URL of the image.

If any of the required fields are missing or invalid, the node should not be output.

If the node is not output, any entities which would otherwise have declared a relationship with the `Image` (e.g., as the `logo` of an `Organization`) should remove those references.

## Optional properties
The following should be added whenever available and valid:

* `caption`: A text string describing the image.
 * Fall back to the image `alt` attribute if no specific `caption` field exists or is defined.

## Conditional properties
Optional properties which should only be output when the required criteria is met.

### When the image has a HTML 'id' property
* `url`: The URL of the image in the context of the current page; e.g., the page's canonical URL appended by the HTML `ID` property of the image (such as https://www.example.com/example-page/#image-123).
* `contentUrl`: The contentUrl property more accurately describes/references the actual image resource than the url property. Technically, this means that we should alter any `url` keys on existing `imageObject` structures to instead use `contentUrl`. However, Googleâ€™s testing tools throw errors in some scenarios when the `url` property is missing (for `logo` and `primaryImageOfPage` in the SDTT, and `primaryImageOfPage` in the RRT). Therefore, we simply add a `contentUrl` property, with a value of the image URL.

### When both height and width dimensions are known
* `height`: The height of the image in pixels
* `width`: The width of the image in pixels

### When the image has a caption (or any other text properties)
* `inLanguage`: The language code for the textual content; e.g., `en-GB`.
